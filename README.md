minishell
<p>This is one of the most difficult projects of <h3>42Yerevan</h3> school</p>
<p>I wrote this project with a Ashot Msryan<./p>
<p>this project runs on Macs and looks like bash</p>
/*this project can be run after this command 1 "make redline"
                                              2  "make"
and run the ./minishell executable*/
